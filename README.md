# Trading API Integration Example

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script designed to demonstrate fluency in Python programming and interacting with trading APIs. The code interacts with a trading API to simulate market activities and orders. 

### Please note:
**This is not a viable trading strategy.** The code is purely for educational purposes and to showcase technical skills in using APIs, handling data, and integrating with external services.

## Features
- **API Interaction**: The code connects to a trading API (such as Alpaca, Binance, or similar) and pulls market data.
- **Order Execution**: Simulates placing orders based on mock logic.
- **Error Handling**: Demonstrates basic error handling when interacting with the API.
- **Data Parsing**: Parses trading data, such as market prices and order book information.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- `requests` or any relevant API wrapper (depending on the trading platform)
- API credentials (obtained from the trading platform)
